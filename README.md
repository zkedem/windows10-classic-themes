# windows10-classic-themes
This is a collection of themes for Windows 10 based on the Classic themes from Windows XP (minus High Contrast).
I chose the GNU AGPL because I realized some systems administrator would install this on a Remote Desktop server at some point. Because the server's filesystem can be locked down for security reasons, I wanted remote users to still be able to access the theme files and modify them directly rather than just use the Personalization settings in Windows. Placing a .ZIP file of the themes in a user-readable directory is a sufficient means of distributing the source.

This repo is still under construction, so avoid committing any changes just yet.
