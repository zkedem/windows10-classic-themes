# windows10-classic-themes
This is a collection of themes for Windows 10 based on the Classic themes from Windows XP (minus High Contrast). The GNU AGPL ensures that if these themes are installed on a Remote Desktop server, the individual users will still be able to create and share derivatives by interacting directly with the source code, as the filesystems of machines in an institutional or organizational setting can be locked down for security purposes. Placing a copy of the theme files in a user-readable directory is a sufficient means of distributing the source.
