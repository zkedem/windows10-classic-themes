# windows10-classic-themes
This is a collection of themes for Windows 10 based on the Classic themes from Windows XP (minus High Contrast), licensed under the GNU GPL, version 3. These themes are great on their own or with a Classic theme enabling utility, like [ClassicTheme.exe](https://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=113024&hilit=Classic+theme+on+Windows+8) or even my own [Set_ClassicTheme](https://github.com/zkedem/Set-ClassicTheme) utility.
